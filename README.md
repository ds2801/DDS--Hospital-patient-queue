# DDS--Hospital-patient-queue
ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This is a queue management system for a hospital. Patients can be either:

Emergency/Critical â†’ handled first using a Priority Queue.

Regular/Normal â†’ handled in FCFS (First Come First Serve) order with a normal queue.

The system will:

Add patients with details (ID, name, severity, estimated treatment time).

Always serve emergency patients first.

Calculate and display estimated wait time for any patient.

Show current queue status.

ðŸ”¹Features in Detail

Patient Data Structure
Each patient has:

Patient ID

Name

Severity (critical or regular)

Estimated treatment time (e.g., 15 mins)

Arrival order (for fairness in regular queue)

Priority Queue for Emergency Cases
Critical patients go into a max-priority queue (priority = severity level, higher = more urgent).

Ensures life-threatening cases are handled first.

Normal Queue for Regular Patients
Implemented as a simple FIFO queue.

Patients are served in order of arrival.

Estimated Wait Time
For emergency patients â†’ wait time = sum of treatment times of emergency patients ahead in priority order.

For regular patients â†’ wait time = (all emergency patientsâ€™ treatment time) + (treatment time of regular patients before them).

Operations
Add new patient (emergency/regular).

Serve next patient (based on queue rules).

Show estimated wait time of a patient.

Display all patients in both queues.

ðŸ”¹ How to Run

Compile the C++ program:

g++ hospital_queue.cpp -o hospital_queue
